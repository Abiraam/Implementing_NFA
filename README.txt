Instructions on how to compile & run (Windows):

!!! Make sure you have the g++ compiler installed !!!

On windows, open the command prompt and change directory into where our 'Main.cpp' file is.

Once in the directory, type the following command:

	g++ -o runNFA.exe Main.cpp

You should now have a 'runNFA.exe' file in the same directory as 'Main.cpp'

Before running the program, have a .txt machine input file in same directory.

Finally, in your command prompt window type the following command:

	runNFA

(Theres a pre compiled exe file included with this project if you can't get it to work)
